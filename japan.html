        <h3>Unit 731</h3>
        <h3 style="font-style:italic">Japan's Biochemical Warfare Unit during WWII</h3>
        <div>
        <p>Unit 731 was one of many covert Biochemical Warfare research centers by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese
              war during WWII. Located in PingFang within the puppet state of Manchukuo in Northern China, some of the most notorious 
              war crimes were carried out there, including lethal human experimentations. <br \>
            When Japan lost WWII, instead of being trialed for war crimes, those involved with Unit 731 were secretly given immunity. General
                Douglas MacArthur granted the researchers immunity in exchange for proving the U.S. with valuable research data obtained from
                the human experiments. <br \> 
            For various reasons, not often taught in school, and is relatively uknown to many. I want bring this topic to light, because even
                though this event is over, learning about history sheds light on releations in East Asian countries today and also serves as
                a warning for us to never repeat another atrocity like this again. <br \>
