        <h3>CPR Training in VR</h3>
        <h3 style="font-style:italic">Top 10 Finalists, UofTHacks</h3>
        <p class="italic">Unity, C#</p>
        <p class="italic">Google Carboard, Leap Motion</p>
        </a>
        <div class="collapse" id="project1">
        <p>We wanted to make CPR training more engaging. In classrooms, we can learn all the basic steps of how to 
            perform CPR, but we do not get the full immersive experience. I have had CPR training before, but I don't
            think I can calmly help someone in need in an actual stressful situation. <br \>
           Moreover, we wanted to make CPR training more accessible. This one headset can be used by many people who
            might need this sort of training, whether it's for personal learning or for the workplace. <br \>
           My main responsibilities were to develop components of the game (ie. researching Leap Motion integration, 
            distortion rendering, interactions between objects and users) and team management (i.e. designing a user story, 
            delegating tasks).
           This application was developed my me and a team of 3 other people at UofTHacks 2017. We won top 10 overall
            at that hackathon. <br \>

        <p>Fun Fact!! Japanese soldiers during WWII did not take their vitamin supplements, and often hid or threw them away.
            to counter this, they named these pills "Russia Subjugation Pellets". The result was immediate -- there was much
            less of a percent of pills being thrown out. To this day, you may find the supplements in countertop drug stores
            in Japan, going by the name of "Russia Subjugation Pellets". </p>
        <br \>
        <p>Sometimes it can be hard to remember to take your regular prescription meds, and it is also hard for doctors to
            monitor whether or not their patient have been taking the prescription. We wanted to harness the power of an
            all hat is already used by so many, Facebook Messenger, and bring another utility into it. TalcumPowder has two
            ends -- from one, doctors can log patient data. From the other, patients register to receive reminders from
            the chatbot. The bot will schedule reminders based on that specific patient's data. <br \>
           Patients can communicate with the bot, asking for details on their medication, or send a message to their doctor, 
            for example.
           Our hope is that this is a low-friction way to encourage users to keep up with medications, specific diets, or
            any doctor prescriptions.

      <h3>CC3K</h3> 
      <p class="italic">C++</p>
      </a>
      <div class="collapse" id="project3">
      <p>CC3K is an ascii Rouge-like game, built in C++. The main character (whose race can be chosen by the player) has to
            climb 5 floors to defeat the game. There's various enemies they face, and they will react differently towards the user, depending on what race the enemy is and what race the player is. <br \>
        This game uses many object-oriented practices as well as design patterns. The entire game's model is a 
            MVC (Model-View-Controller), and enemies, actions, and such have been abstracted and encapsulated into 
            classes. Effects of potions was achieved with the Decorator pattern. And the Factory Method Pattern to 
            randomly generate enemies, potions, and gold. The Visitor Pattern was used to handle attacks and responses 
            to attacks. <br \>
         CC3k was built for a school project, in a team of 4.
         The Github repo is private, because of its nature as a school project that may be reused by professors in the 
            future. However, screenshots and a demo has been provided.</p>
