            Rebuilt QA processes by automating test plan creation and solidifying workflow<br \>
            Resolved issues at the root and reported bug tickets on JIRA <br \>
            Worked with JIRA in an agile environment <br \>
            Managed weekly emails, release sign-offs, and notes from playtests <br \> <br \>

            My Job <br \>
            QA Engineer Co-op, working on Zynga's mobile games such as Word Streak, Hanging, Chess, New Chess, Matching, and Gems With Friends <br \>
            Responsible for: <br \>
            - test plan writing and manual test execution <br \>
            - signing off builds to deploy them to the market <br \>
            - monitoring public sentiments (through reviews, on social media, customer service tickets) <br \>
            - debugging and reproducing market bugs (bugs found by customers on live releases)<br \>
            - providing high-quality bug reports that were the most useful to the developers <br \>
            - determined priority of tickets for JIRA <br \>
            - managed and emailed weekly reports of all the QA tasks completed that week <br \>
            - took notes of feedback and bugs during team-wide playtests and relayed bugs to developers <br \> <br \>

            
            What I learned <br \> 
            - working in a fully Agile enviornment (scrum, sprints, using issue-trackers like JIRA, retrospectives) <br \>
            - how to work with remote teams (since the Zynga HQ is at San Francisco, team dynamics were sometimes different
                than if the entire team was physically together) <br \>
            - how to find the root cause of issues and dig for information when you're not given much to work with <br \ >
            - effectively communicating with team members <br \>
            - accountability with all team members <br \>
            - how to effectively test black box portions of software <br \>
            - how product managers decide which features to develop and which features to scrap <br \>
            - usefullness of experiment-gating new features (releasing it only to a small percentage of users and 
                ramping that percentage up if response is positive) <br \>

        <p style="font-size: 14px;">Fun Fact!! Japanese soldiers during WWII did not take their vitamin supplements, and often hid or threw them away.
            to counter this, they named these pills "Russia Subjugation Pellets". The result was immediate -- there was much
            less of a percent of pills being thrown out. To this day, you may find the supplements in countertop drug stores
            in Japan, going by the name of "Russia Subjugation Pellets". </p>

        <p style="font-size: 14px;">Sometimes it can be hard to remember to take your regular prescription meds, and it is also hard for doctors to
            monitor whether or not their patient have been taking the prescription. We wanted to harness the power of an
            all hat is already used by so many, Facebook Messenger, and bring another utility into it. TalcumPowder has two
            ends -- from one, doctors can log patient data. From the other, patients register to receive reminders from
            the chatbot. The bot will schedule reminders based on that specific patient's data. <br \>
           Patients can communicate with the bot, asking for details on their medication, or send a message to their doctor, 
            for example.
           Our hope is that this is a low-friction way to encourage users to keep up with medications, specific diets, or
            any doctor prescriptions.

      <h3>Co-founder, Chief Financial Officer, and Tutor</h3> 
      <h3 style="font-style: italic">Canopy Tutoring</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 14px;"> 
        Established a small, non-profit organization<br />
        Donated more than $4 000 to a local educational charity <br />
        
        Canopy Tutoring allowed me to do something I love -- sharing whatever knowledge or wisdom I have at others, while helping anothers that I'm not directly in contact with. <br \>
        Whatever lessons I've learned, whether it was through school, or through experience, I take every opportunity I can to impart these lessons on others who may be interested. Starting and being a part of Canopy tutoring allowed me to tutor students of different ages, from teaching counting to kindergarten students to piano for elementary students to improving French literary for highschool students. Since we dealt with such a large range of students, it was important to recognize the core needs and capabilities of each student. The way I taught basic french to elementary students was different from the more technical approach I took when explaining various verb conjugations to high-schoolers. I would prepare lessons, allot time for practice, and check in with how the student is progressing once in a while. <br \> 
        Apart from Canopy, I also liked to look for other opportunities where I have a chance to do so. 
        I've volunteered with Ladies Learning Code to mentor young girls, teaching them Scratch and getting them interested in computer science. I've put in considerable effort while in Air Cadets as an instructor, planning out lessons, field trips, and preparing extra enriching material -- I was awarded with the Best Instructor Award at our Squadron.
